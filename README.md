# NumericalAnalysis

Project in order to implement RK2 integral for Riemann integration of continuous functions in C++. To say it simple: if you take a function, and you give the program the boundaries, this is able to calculate
the integrate (area between the curve and the x-axis) with better brecision using RK2 algorithm

It implemnents:
- pointers
- genericity with templates
- object oriented
